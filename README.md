The Enatega multi-vendor food delivery solution is perfect for anyone wanting a ready-made, user-friendly platform for their food delivery and logistics business. Like popular services such as Foodpanda and Uber Eats, our system supports multiple restaurants, including those with locations in different areas.
With an accessible admin panel and dedicated apps for customers, restaurants, and delivery riders, you can quickly set up your online food ordering and delivery management system.
Enatega food delivery system was created to help small and large eateries who want to expand their business and increase visibility.
Our solution is open source, but the backend and API are proprietary. You can access them through a paid license.
